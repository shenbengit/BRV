BRV can be integrated with Net to enhance its functionality in terms of network requests and asynchronous tasks.

To integrate Net into your project, you need to add the Net dependency to your project's build.gradle file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.liangjingkanji:Net:<version>'
}
```

Replace `<version>` with the specific version of Net you want to use. It's recommended to use a specific version instead of the `+` symbol to ensure stability.

With Net integration, you can leverage the following features:

- [Auto Refresh](https://liangjingkanji.github.io/Net/auto-refresh/): Automatically trigger pull-to-refresh functionality in the RecyclerView.
- [Auto Paging](https://liangjingkanji.github.io/Net/auto-page/): Automatically load more data when scrolling reaches the end of the RecyclerView.
- [Auto State](https://liangjingkanji.github.io/Net/auto-state/): Automatically handle empty, loading, and error states in the RecyclerView.

By combining BRV with Net, you can create a powerful and efficient solution for handling network requests and providing a seamless user experience.
